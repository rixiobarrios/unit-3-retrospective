- Technical debt

## Learnings / Takeaways

- Having a QA/Testing person to 'break' the app and find errors
- Explore Material UI, Bootstrap, and other new technologies based on other projects
- Get caught up on sleep, and also maybe don't work so late next time
- MongoDB
- RTFM and evaluate before deciding to use a new technology
- Wont know until you try; hands-on approach; know everything may not work and don't be afraid to scrap an idea for a better one
- MVP as a road to success

## Future Directions

- Asking about agile/scrum, team dynamics during interviews and job search
- Python
- Excited for Project 4
- User authentication
- Testing, more complex Testing
- User Testing
